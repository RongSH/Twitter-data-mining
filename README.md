# Twitter data mining - social media as a rising customer service channel 
- [Thesis paper](https://github.com/RongSH/Twitter-data-mining/blob/master/TwitterDataMining.pdf)

Collect data from Twitter API using Python scripts that records the customer service interactions on major consumer electronic brands such as Apple and Samsung. Then use Natural Language Processing techniques such as Sentiment Analysis to analyze the data, in order to study social media as a new customer service channel.

Unfortunately my codes are forever gone with damaged computer, and I was too inexperienced to back it up on github.
