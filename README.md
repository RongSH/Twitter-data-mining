- [Thesis paper](https://github.com/RongSH/Twitter-data-mining/blob/master/TwitterDataMining.pdf)

- Collect data from Twitter API using Python scripts that records the customer service interactions on major consumer electronic brands such as Apple and Samsung
- Parse Json data objects in Python and organize tweets into customer service sessions with unique customers with Pandas
- Use NLTK(Natural Language Processing toolkit) to conduct Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis 
- Use Naive Bayes classifier and bag of words method to predict sentiment of a customer towards the customer service received

Unfortunately my codes are forever gone with damaged computer, and I was too inexperienced to back it up on github.
